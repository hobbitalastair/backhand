# TODO

- Rewrite `bh-*` in C (for performance)
- Fix the races inherent in the shell scripts
- Expand the documentation to include man pages for all of the utilities and
  usage examples, and document the service script format
- Point to existing service scripts
- Improve logging support
- Consider using a simple file format instead of scripts for encoding (eg)
  dependency information to reduce redundancy and improve performance
- Add tests
